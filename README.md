# 🚌 Dynamic School Bus Route Optimization & Monitoring Platform

> A web-based system for dynamically generating and monitoring school bus routes based on daily operational conditions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional school transportation systems use fixed routes and static schedules that cannot adapt to daily changes. This platform solves that by applying **rule-based dynamic routing** that accounts for:
- Daily student attendance
- Bus capacity constraints
- Pickup time windows
- Simulated traffic conditions

pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your PostgreSQL credentials

alembic upgrade head             # Run migrations
uvicorn app.main:app --reload    # Start server
```

API will be live at: `http://localhost:8000`

### Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern** — Swappable routing algorithm strategies
- **Observer Pattern** — Event-driven alert notifications
- **Factory Pattern** — Centralized object creation

### SOLID Principles
- **S** — Each service handles one domain concern
- **O** — BaseEntity & strategies open for extension, closed for modification
- **L** — All routing strategies are interchangeable
- **I** — Separate Pydantic schemas per operation
- **D** — Routes depend on service interfaces, not implementations
